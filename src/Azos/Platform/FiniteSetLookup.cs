  /// <summary>
  /// Provides a thread-safe lock-free lookup by TKey of a finite(constrained by design to 512K) set of TValue items, such as system types.
  /// The set is constrained by design in two ways: it can only add items if they are not present in the set already,
  /// and the total item count must be finite/limited by system design (e.g. system Type instances, Attribute instances etc.), 512K is the hard maximum count limit.
  /// This class is used for efficient thread-safe caching of items by TKey, speculating on the fact that total set
  /// of items is limited and with time the system will add all of items, consequently no mutations will be necessary
  /// and all requests will be served by lock-free thread-safe read-only Get() operation on an immutable copy.
  /// This class is inefficient for adding items which do not exist in the set, as it creates yet another copy of the internal dictionary.
  /// The AddItem functor is called under the lock and must not have any side effects (must contain only read code which gets TValue by TKey from source).
  /// </summary>

  /// DO NOT store business data which changes or has high value variability.

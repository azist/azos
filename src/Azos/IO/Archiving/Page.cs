      NOTE Re: design choice for reuse of Page instances

      Keep in mind, that archive reading/scrolling is not necessarily always going to materialize Entry objects.
      You might just get the binary page data and analyze it in place without a higher-level read accessor, consequently
      scrolling thorough a page may be a completely allocation-free procedure, therefore
      it is important to NOT make any extra allocations, more so in a small LOH range which will load GC.

      By avoiding Page instance allocation we can reuse the underlying memory chunk which otherwise would have been trashed
      with every page fetch.

# Framework Testing

Back to [Documentation Index](/src/documentation-index.md)


This directory contains testing code. Azos testing code is written using [Azos.Scripting](/src/Azos/Scripting) and
 [Aver.cs](/src/Azos/Aver.cs) "assertion" library. The testing philosophy is described here. TBD

**Warning**: Do not use `System.Console` in your tests, instead use [`Conout`](/src/Azos/Scripting) which has similar signature but is 
redirectable in a thread-safe way. Internally, `Conout` redirects output to [`IConsolePort`](/src/Azos/IO/Console) which 
sends output to either local console or can be connected to an external console a.k.a. **TV (TeleVision) system** 
for remote/cloud debugging.

There are **three test "tiers"** used in Azos framework:

1. [Azos.Tests.Nub](Azos.Tests.Nub) - tests the very base "core" of the framework - the functionality 
 which everything else is based on (config, app chassis, modules etc.). The nub tests must be quick to 
 execute and they are used for basic regression testing while developing Azos itself. Nub testing does not
 (and it should not) provide full comprehensive coverage of functionality, rather it is purposed to
 **quickly ascertain the correctness** of framework "very core" (hence the name)
1. [Azos.Tests.Unit](Azos.Tests.Unit) - covers the Azos framework as a whole with unit tests some of which
 may take significant amount of time to execute. The tests are categorized using the "base" identifier to further
 narrow the testing scope
1. [Azos.Tests.Integration](Azos.Tests.Integration) - tests various components together, requiring external services
 (such as local DB server instance) for some tests. These tests are usually long running and concentrate on inter-service
 consumption and multi-threading

### Quick cheats:

##### Run Tests using CLI
Run nub tests from console using the `sky` DLL. After building you will need to navigate to the `/out/Debug/` directory, this contains the `sky` platform which is used to execute `trun` on the provided .dll, running the command below will execute all of the tests within the `Azos.Tests.Nub.dll` and output the results to the console. 
```bash
~/azos/out/Debug
$ ./sky trun Azos.Tests.Nub.dll
```

> Azos is built using .NET Standard 2.1 and is cross platform by design. The following examples use `bash`, but any appropriate CLI will work.

##### Get CLI Help
You can get a full list of commands and syntax by executing the following command.
```bash
~/azos/out/Debug
$ ./sky trun -?
```

##### Run Specific Tests
Use the `-r` switch to configure test script runner with **pattern search predicate expressions**.
Pattern expressions uses `?` for a single character match and `*` for multiple characters. 
The `~` character denotes "not"/inversion and may appear ONLY appear at the start of a pattern expression.

For example:
- `*Session` will match strings ending with "Session"
- `~*Session` will match anything BUT strings ending with "Session"
- `Test_?3` matches on any single character before "3" at the end

You can apply pattern search to the following properties of runnable classes/methods:
- Categories - defined via `[Runnable(category: "mycategory1"]` attribute decoration (see categories note below)
- Namespace names - pattern applied to namespace names which contain `[Runnable]` classes
- Method names - pattern applied to class/method names
- Names - named test cases


You can **combine multiple pattern** filters using `,` `;` or `|` delimiters.
When processing patterns the system applies logic depending on the pattern types: direct, or inverted.
Non-inverted (direct) patterns are combined using `ORs` as in "match any of": `a*;b*;c*`.
The inverted patterns starting with `~` are combined with `ANDs` as in "match none of": `~a*;~b*;~c*`.
If both pattern types are specified, then the system applies all `ORs` first then all `ANDs`:  
 `(direct1 [|| directX])[&& inverted1][&& invertedX]` etc.

Search by namespace names (using OR):
```batch
~/azos/out/Debug
$ ./sky trun Azos.Tests.Nub.dll -r namespaces=RunnerTests.Inject*;MyLogic.DB.*
```

Search by namespace names and method names:

```bash
~/azos/out/Debug
$ ./sky trun Azos.Tests.Nub.dll -r namespaces=RunnerTests.Inject* methods=*Json_Read?-* names=case?
# with AND NOT
$ ./sky trun Azos.Tests.Nub.dll -r namespaces=*Inject*;*Session*;~*Secur* methods=~*Json*
```

Specific method names:
```bash
~/azos/out/Debug/
$ ./sky trun Azos.Test.Nub.dll -r methods=*AsJson*
```

Cases of specific category:
```bash
#hub or draw categories
$ ./sky trun MyTests.dll -r categories=hub,draw

# but not i/o tests
$ ./sky MyTests.dll -r categories=hub,draw,~io

# hub category, namespace "Serialization", any method but for the ones called "_Fail"
$ ./sky MyTests.dll -r categories=hub namespaces=*Serialization* method=~*_Fail
```

> If categories filter is specified then it expects that category on the `[Runnable]` declaration, then if there is at least one method with `[Run]` spcifying the category then 
> the rest of method declarations must also specify category. In other words: **if none of the runnable methods have category set**, then the **category specification cascades down from 
> runnable class level to its individual methods**

Use `names` parameter to invoke **explicitly-named test cases**:
```bash
~/azos/out/Debug
$ ./sky trun MyTesting.dll -r names=MySpecialTest
```
then use of the **explicitly-named run case** in code:
```CSharp
[Run("!MySpecialTest"...]//note the use of "!" - unless you pass the
                         //test name explicitly it will not auto run
public void Special()
{
 ...Aver.IsTrue(...)...
}
```



##### Emulate Tests
This is needed to see what tests will run, but don't run them. Emulation helps to identify the test
configuration/setup issues.
```bash
~/azos/out/Debug
$ ./sky trun Azos.Tests.Integration.dll -r emulate=true
```

##### Save Results into File
Pass `out=<file>.xml|json|laconf` specifier to the `-host` switch:
```bash
~/azos/out/Debug
$ ./sky trun Azos.Tests.Integration.dll -host out="~/azos/out/results.laconf"
```

##### Custom Testing Host
In some CI/CD environments (e.g. [Azure DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/devops/)) you may need to run the tests in a different hosting environment, for example
Azos uses [Appveyor](https://www.appveyor.com/) service for its CI auto build.

The `-host` switch is used to inject a different text host type (taken from `appveyor.yml')`:
```yml
 test_script:
 - cd ..\out\Release
 - trun Azos.Tests.Nub.dll -ec -host type="Azos.Scripting.TestRunnerAppVeyorHost, Azos"
```

In the example above, the `Azos.Scripting.TestRunnerAppVeyorHost` uses special hooks
specific to [Appveyor Build Worker API](https://www.appveyor.com/docs/build-worker-api/) 
to report testing results in real time
